# Anime Repository

## Overview

Welcome to our anime repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing a list of anime sorted by popularity, presented in card form. It's built using Next.js, making it a great resource for learning server-side actions.

Already I've done some changes to the base code of Adrian Hajdin, first following his tutorial on YouTube and second adding the charachters page. Here's the link of the repo that I've started from: [Starting Repo](https://github.com/sajeed11/anime_vault)

## New Features

From Adrian Next.js project in YouTube, I want to add some new features to better understood server-actions and more stuff in Next.js and Typescript.

### Clickable Cards

Each anime card in the list is now clickable. When users click on a card, they'll be directed to a dedicated page for that anime.

### Detailed Anime Page

On the dedicated anime page, users can find a wealth of additional information:

#### More Images

Additional images related to the anime are now displayed on the page, providing users with a visual feast.

#### Synopsis

A detailed synopsis of the anime is included, helping users to get a better understanding of the storyline and premise.

#### Related Content

Users can discover related anime or content based on their interests and preferences.

### Improved Navigation

Navigation has been enhanced to ensure seamless transition between different sections of the site. Users can easily explore the anime list, view detailed information about specific anime, and interact with the community features.

### Accessibility

We've prioritized accessibility in our design, ensuring that all users, regardless of their abilities, can easily navigate and interact with the site.

### Performance Optimization

To enhance performance, we've optimized the codebase and implemented caching mechanisms to ensure fast loading times, even during peak traffic periods.
